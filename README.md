## üìä Project Overview

This project implements a **self-supervised remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)** pipeline using facial video analysis. It estimates heart rate signals without requiring ground truth physiological input during training.

---

## üöÄ Highlights

- üí° **Self-Supervised Learning**: Frequency-domain contrastive learning for physiological signal estimation  
- üñ•Ô∏è **Distributed Training**: Multi-GPU support via PyTorch DDP  
- üîê **Privacy Preservation**: Anonymized preprocessing for healthcare datasets  
- üéöÔ∏è **Signal Processing**: Robust FFT-based heart rate extraction  
- üß© **Model Architecture**: PhysNet-based 3D CNN for spatiotemporal learning  

---

## üî¨ Technical Design

### Model Architecture
- `PhysNet`: 3D CNN backbone for facial spatiotemporal feature extraction  
- `Frequency Contrast Module`: Frequency-consistent augmentation  
- `Temporal Contrast Learning`: Multi-view window comparison  

### Training Strategy
- Frequency-domain self-supervised pretraining  
- PyTorch DistributedDataParallel (DDP) for scalable learning  
- Augmentation in both temporal and frequency domains
