## Overview
This project implements a self-supervised learning approach for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) using facial video analysis. The system can estimate heart rate from facial videos without requiring ground truth physiological signals during training.

## Key Features

- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Novel frequency-domain contrastive learning approach
- **Distributed Training**: Multi-GPU training support with PyTorch DDP
- **Data Privacy**: Anonymized preprocessing workflows for healthcare datasets
- **Signal Processing**: Advanced FFT-based heart rate estimation
- **Model Architecture**: PhysNet-based 3D CNN for spatiotemporal feature extraction


## Technical Approach

### Model Architecture
- **PhysNet**: 3D CNN backbone for extracting spatiotemporal features from facial videos
- **Frequency Contrast Module**: Self-supervised learning through frequency domain augmentation
- **Multi-view Temporal Learning**: Contrastive learning across different temporal windows

### Training Strategy
- **Self-Supervised Pretraining**: Frequency domain consistency learning
- **Distributed Training**: PyTorch DistributedDataParallel for scalable training
- **Data Augmentation**: Temporal and frequency domain augmentations
